          <h2>What is Arken?</h2>
          <p> 
            Arken is a distributed storage system built to archive important open source
            and scientific data. Instead of requiring a central server, Arken is made up
            of many distributed computers all working together. These computers pool
            their individual resources to form a shared global storage cluster. 
            Taking advantage of many small computers, Arken has a cheaper entry cost 
            per node than many traditional storage systems. For example, a member of
            the Arken cluster can be made up of almost any computer with available
            storage space -- including a $35 Raspberry Pi. 
          </p>

          <h2>Building a Stronger Future</h2>
          <p>
            Many researchers, museums, and archivists are struggling to host and
            protect a vast amount of important public data. Although the price of
            high capacity hard drives has decreased significantly in recent years,
            most open-source and scientific organizations don't have the ability to
            build and maintain their own hosting infrastructure. As such, many groups
            have no other options but to rely on expensive cloud storage providers. 
            Sustainably-funded projects can afford the recurring costs of cloud data 
            storage, but projects with short-term grants cannot. Once their funding is 
            exhausted, researchers are often left with only their own hard drives to
            store data. Ultimately, this is a fragile arrangement, as a single lost or failed 
            disk can result in the loss of valuable data.
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, many museums cannot afford to digitize their collections,
            because of the lasting monthly expenses cloud storage would require.
            <br>
            <br>
            After working with a number of these grant supported projects and watching them fail to find
            a sustainable storage solution, we designed Arken so that we could collectively build 
            a better lasting storage system not dependent on any one entity.

          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>
            Arken wouldn't be possible without the contributions of people like you.
            If you are interested in contributing to the Arken cluster and happen to 
            have an old or spare computer, check out our documentation 
            <a href='/docs/upload'><b>here</b></a> to see how you can help protect 
            scientific and open source data. If you're interested in buying an Arken
            node to help out the cluster, we're working on that and will hopefully have 
            some exciting news for you soon. If you're a researcher or expert in a field 
            and would like to help us review new additions to the Arken cluster 
            sign up to be an Arken reviewer <a href='/docs/upload'><b>here</b></a>.

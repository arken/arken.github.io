          <h2>What is Arken?</h2>
          <p> 
            Arken is a distributed storage system built to archive important open source
            and scientific data. Instead of requiring a central server, Arken is made up
            of many distributed computers all working together. These computers pool
            their individual resources to form a shared global storage cluster. 
            Taking advantage of many small computers Arken is both cheaper and more 
            scalable than many traditional storage systems. For example, a member of
            the Arken cluster can be made up of almost anything -- including a $35 dollar 
            Raspberry Pi. 
          </p>

          <h2>Building a Stronger Future</h2>
          <p>
            Many researchers, museums, and archivists are struggling to host and
            protect a vast amount of important public data. Although the price of
            high capacity hard drives has decreased significantly in recent years,
            most open-source and scientific organizations don't have the ability to
            build and maintain their own hosting infrastructure. As such many groups
            get trapped relying on expensive cloud storage providers. For continuously well
            funded projects, cloud storage is an excepted line item, but for smaller projects
            with short term grants, once the grant money runs out often times researchers are
            forced to pull their data to offline external hard drives.
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover many museums simply can't afford to take the steps to digitize their collections
            because of the lasting monthly expenses cloud storage would require.
            <br>
            <br>
            After working with a number of these grant supported projects and watching them fail to find
            a sustainable storage solution, we decided to build Arken to collectively build a lasting
            storage solution.

          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>
            Arken wouldn't be possible without the contributions of people like you. If you've
            got an old or spare computer checkout the Arken Docs to learn how you can add
            it to the Arken cluster. If you're a researcher or expert in a field help us review
            new additions to the Arken cluster by signing up as an Arken reviewer.

          <h2>What is Arken?</h2>
          <p> 
            Arken is a distributed hard drive built to archive important open source
            and scientific data. Instead of requiring any central computer, Arken is made up
            of many distributed computers all working together. These computers pool
            their individual resources to form a shared global storage pool. 
            Taking advantage of many small computers, Arken builds a globally redundant
            storage system that is only limited in size by the number people contributing
            their hard drive space. Moreover, members of the Arken system can be made up of 
            almost any computer with available storage space -- including a $35 Raspberry Pi. 
          </p>

          <h2>Building a Stronger Future</h2>
          <p>
            Many researchers, museums, and archivists are struggling to host and
            protect a vast amount of important public data. Although the price of
            high capacity hard drives has decreased significantly in recent years,
            most open-source and scientific organizations don't have the ability to
            build and maintain their own hosting infrastructure. As such, many groups
            have no other options but to rely on expensive cloud storage providers. 
            Sustainably-funded projects can afford the recurring costs of cloud data 
            storage, but projects with short-term grants cannot. Once their funding is 
            exhausted, researchers are often left with only their own hard drives to
            store data. Ultimately, this is a fragile arrangement, as a single lost or failed 
            disk can result in the loss of valuable data.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, many museums cannot afford to digitize their collections,
            because of the lasting monthly expenses cloud storage would require.
            Limiting the accessability and security of their collections.
            <br>
            <br>
            After working with a number of these grant supported projects and watching them fail to find
            a sustainable storage solution, we designed Arken so that we could collectively build 
            a better lasting storage system not dependent on any one entity.

          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>
            Arken itself is an open source project and community 
            who's goal is to help protect public data. If you
            are interested in becoming a part of this community there
            are many ways in which you can help us.
            <br>
            <br>
            1) If you have an old or spare computer, help contribute
            its extra storage space to grow the cluster, check out our
